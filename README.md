# DropBall

A gameshow-style prop made in Unity used to aide quizzes during COVID-19 lockdown

The game master can set up the number of game players, their token colour, and sound-effect of choice before starting the game

The game consists of 3 levels (chosen at random) where the game master can select whether the current player got the question correct, incorrect, or chose to pass. Getting the question correct sends that player's token through the level, where they gain or lose points depending on how luck favours them.
